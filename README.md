Tweeter is an automation platform capable of simulating an organic social media presence. Tweeter must first be given access to your account via providing keys generated from apps.twitter.com and can be revoked at any time (blocking Twetr's connection). Currently, the only automated task is to scrape a specified subreddit and retweet the content on a specified interval. Tasks and search resutls are both table-based and feature entry-specific buttons (Follow User, Retweet, or Delete Task).
